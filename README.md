## Script Purpose
üíª This script allows user to quickly collect commit messages from perforce server since desired revision. It may be used for regression testing in various domains.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note that if your commit messages contain Jira-ID in format ID-XXXX, it will automatically open jira filter with affected issues.

## Pre-conditions
Before using this script, make sure you have Perforce client and Command Line Interface .exe installed.
1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed. You can download it freely at [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Proceed to commit_parser.py file and change variables project_code and jira_url to desired ones. (Note that jira url should contain everything before jql query part)

## Running the script
To use the script, simply run the **commits.bat** file. On the first launch (or if authentication token is expired) it will ask you to enter your credentials. This step will be omitted if authentication check exits with 0 error code later.

**commits.bat** file prompts user for revision number to filter commits. Simply type in numeric value of revision that will serve as a lower threshold for your commits file.

If executed successfully, commits since revision you typed in will be output to **commits_since_rXXXX.txt** file in script's root directory. Also jira filter with affected issues (if commit messages have jira ID in them) will open in your default browser.
